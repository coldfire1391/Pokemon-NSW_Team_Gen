This is a team generator for Pokemon such that no team members share the same weakness. It's a No-Shared-Weakness team gen.
You'll need Python installed onto your machine if you want to execute the code. Just follow this tutorial: https://youtu.be/UvcQlPZ8ecA (You only need to watch until 4:00)

2. Save the download to your Desktop
3. Extract it to it's corresponding folder

5a: Type "pip install numpy==1.19.3" and press Enter. Wait for package to install.
5b: Type "pip install pandas" and press Enter. Wait for package to install.
6. Change working directory to folder continaing the code (which should be on your desktop).
